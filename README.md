# Initial low entropy,Matter generation and Anomalous galaxy rotation curves in early cosmic stage

Explaining the Connection Between Initial Low Entropy, Matter Generation, and Anomalous Galaxy Rotation Curves in the Early Cosmic Stage

As the spin kinetic energy becomes increasingly uniformly distributed—an irreversible entropy increase process—the proportion of mass states in the universe gradually decreases through repeated oscillations. Eventually, all mass states are transformed into energy states, meaning the spin kinetic energy distribution of the SEQ network becomes uniform, and the universe enters oscillation in a thermal equilibrium state.

During the early stage of cosmic expansion, the spin kinetic energy was concentrated in a limited number of SEQ, which is consistent with the low-entropy state required by thermodynamics. 

This mechanism, in which high spatial compression collaborates with high-energy fixed-chirality spin of SEQ to generate mass, may also explain the observed anomalies in galaxy rotation curves. Specifically, the early universe featured a high concentration of spin kinetic energy among a small subset of SEQ. This intense spin concentration, coupled with the extreme spatial compression, facilitated the formation of mass. Consequently, the resulting mass structures and their surrounding space likely retain higher-than-expected spinor, which could account for the observed rotational dynamics in galaxies.

Why is there a global gravitational tension-restoring potential in the first stage of cosmic expansion, even though the entire space is in a compressed phase? Because the compression level within mass structures is significantly higher than that of the surrounding space, leading to a large gradient in spatial deformation, which gives rise to a relative tension-restoring potential — the gravitational potential.
