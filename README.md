# Initial low entropy,Matter generation and Anomalous galaxy rotation curves in early cosmic stage

Explaining the Connection Between Initial Low Entropy, Matter Generation, and Anomalous Galaxy Rotation Curves in the Early Cosmic Stage

## Supplementary description of the initial low-entropy state of the universe
Before the Big Bang, the universe was in a highly compressed state. The elastic potential energy was divided into two components: one was spatial compression potential energy, and the other was spatial twistor potential energy(Space network spinor). The spatial twistor potential energy was concentrated in an extremely small region of space — this constituted the initial low-entropy state. After the Big Bang, the twistor potential energy from this tiny region was released through conversion into SEQ resonant kinetic energy and SEQ spin kinetic energy, and this energy was then conducted to other regions of space. This process represents the specific mechanism of entropy increase.​

This mechanism, in which high spatial compression collaborates with space network spinor to generate mass, may also explain the observed anomalies in galaxy rotation curves. Specifically, the early universe featured a high concentration of network spinor. This intense network spinor concentration, coupled with the extreme spatial compression, facilitated the formation of mass. Consequently, the resulting mass structures and their surrounding space likely retain higher-than-expected spinor, which could account for the observed rotational dynamics in galaxies.
